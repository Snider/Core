# Core

Core is a Web3 Framework, written in Go using Wails.io to replace Electron and the bloat of browsers that, at their core, still live in their mum's basement.

## Quick start

```go
import core "github.com/Snider/Core"

app := core.New(
  core.WithServiceLock(),
)
```

## Development Workflow

This project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. We use [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for task automation to streamline the development process.

The recommended workflow is:

1.  **Generate Tests**: For any changes to the public API, first generate the necessary test stubs.

    ```bash
    task test-gen
    ```

2.  **Run Tests (and watch them fail)**: Verify that the new tests fail as expected.

    ```bash
    task test
    ```

3.  **Implement Your Feature**: Write the code to make the tests pass.

4.  **Run Tests Again**: Ensure all tests now pass.

    ```bash
    task test
    ```

5.  **Submit for Review**: Once your changes are complete and tests are passing, submit them for a CodeRabbit review.

    ```bash
    task review
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `pkg/`: Contains the core Go packages that make up the framework.
- `cmd/`: Contains the entry points for the two main applications:
  - `core-gui/`: The Wails-based GUI application.
  - `core/`: The command-line interface (CLI) application.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Wails](https://wails.io/)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/)

## Building and Running

### GUI Application

To run the GUI application in development mode:

```bash
task gui:dev
```

To build the final application for your platform:

```bash
task gui:build
```

### CLI Application

To build the CLI application:

```bash
task cli:build
```

The executable will be located in the `cmd/core/bin` directory.

## Available Tasks

To run any of the following tasks, open your terminal in the project's root directory and execute the `task` command.

### General Tasks

- `task test`: Runs all Go tests recursively for the entire project.
- `task test-gen`: Generates tests for the public API.
- `task check`: A comprehensive check that runs `go mod tidy`, the full test suite, and a CodeRabbit review.
- `task review`: Submits the current changes for a CodeRabbit review.
- `task cov`: Generates a test coverage profile (`coverage.txt`).
- `task cov-view`: Opens the HTML coverage report in your browser.
- `task sync`: Updates the public API Go files to match the exported interface of the modules.

### GUI Application (`cmd/core-gui`)

These tasks are run from the root directory and operate on the GUI application.

- `task gui:build`: Builds the GUI application.
- `task gui:package`: Packages a production build of the GUI application.
- `task gui:run`: Runs the GUI application.
- `task gui:dev`: Runs the GUI application in development mode, with hot-reloading enabled.

### CLI Application (`cmd/core`)

These tasks are run from the root directory and operate on the CLI application.

- `task cli:build`: Builds the CLI application.
- `task cli:build:dev`: Builds the CLI application for development.
- `task cli:run`: Builds and runs the CLI application.
- `task cli:sync`: Updates the public API Go files.
- `task cli:test-gen`: Generates tests for the public API.

## Docs (MkDocs)
The help site and inâ€‘app docs are built with MkDocs Material and live under `pkg/v1/core/docs`.

- Live preview: from `pkg/v1/core/docs` run
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `mkdocs serve -o -c` (or `task dev` if you use Task)
- Build static site: `mkdocs build --clean -d public` (or `task build`)

The demo app embeds the built docs from `public/` and can open specific sections in new windows using stable, short headings.
